# Behavioral Interview 

> [Top Interview](https://www.topinterview.com/interview-advice/spotify-interview-questions-and-answers): Situation: Think about a situation or challenge you've faced at work that directly relates to the question at hand. 
> This might include working with data, managing projects, communicating with difficult clients, or leading a team.

>For example, one Glassdoor user said they were asked, “How do you rely on data in organizing projects?” during their Spotify interview.
In that case, you'd want to think about a time you've used data to help organize your project, giving the interviewer a general 
overview of the situation.

>Task: Talk about the task at hand and the role you played in handling the situation. For example, maybe your manager assigned you to 
reconfigure your team's workflow to eliminate some major inefficiencies.

>Action: Here, you'll explain exactly what steps you took to carry out the task. If you used data to help organize a project, explain 
what programs you used and how you leveraged the data to offer project-management insights. 

>Result: Finally, describe the result. What impact did you make by using data to organize your projects? If you can, get as specific
and concrete as possible, and use numbers to show your success.

  case fetchError
}

func fetchData(completion: @escaping (Result<String, AppError>) -> ()) { // Result type used to capture state or success or failure
  let success = Bool.random() 
  if success {
    completion(.success("Success"))
  } else {
    completion(.failure(.fetchError))
  }
}

fetchData { result in 
  switch result {
    case .success (let str): 
      print(str) // "Success"
    case .failure (let error): 
      print("error found: \(error)") // error found: fetchError
  }
}
```

#### What is ARC ? 

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 

Prior to Automatic reference counting in Objective-C developers needed to keep track of retain and release cycles of objects that were created. With the introduction of ARC now the system does most of the automatic retain/release counting and mememory management for us with limitations such as capturing closures where we need to use weak/unowned as needed.

#### What is TestFlight and describe its process ? 

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 

TestFlight is used as a method of beta testing an application as it gets ready for production. 

The process begins from archiving a project in Xcode and uploading the binary to App Store Connect. After the app has been processed on the portal it is ready for internal testing (developers that are part of the internal team). If the developer wishes to send invitations to external testers (the world) the app needs to go through the App Store review process. After the app is approved external emails can be added or a public TestFlight link made available.
